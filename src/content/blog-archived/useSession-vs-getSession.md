## Why you dont get the session object in getServerSession() in Next.js

useSession() triggers a request to /api/auth/session, so it will only work on the client side. 
Therefore it also will go through your NextAuth.js configuration and will return the session object.

getServerSession() directly reads the session without triggering a request to /api/auth/session or going through your NextAuth.js configuration.
