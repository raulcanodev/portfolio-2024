This practice is crucial in software development as it helps maintain a high-quality codebase. \r\n\r\nHere are some of the key reasons why refactoring is important:\r\n\r\n### 1. Improve code legibility\r\n\r\nRefactoring code helps improve the readability of the codebase. By restructuring the code and removing unnecessary complexity, you can make the code easier to understand for other developers.\r\n\r\nRight now you may understand the code you wrote, but what about in a few months or years?\r\n\r\nAs my favorite meme says: \"When I wrote this code, only God and I understood what I was doing. Now, only God knows.\"\r\n\r\n### 2. Enhance code maintainability\r\n\r\nMake it easier to maintain and update the code. By breaking down large functions into smaller, more manageable pieces, you can make it easier to fix bugs and add new features.\r\n\r\n### 3. Increase code scalability\r\n\r\nRemoving unnecessary dependencies and restructuring the code helps improve the scalability of the codebase. This makes it easier to scale the codebase as your project grows.\r\n\r\nYou should do reusable code, don't repeat yourself (DRY), and keep it simple, stupid (KISS).\r\n\r\n### 4. Improve code performance\r\n\r\nOptimizing the code and removing bottlenecks can help improve the performance of the codebase, making the code run faster and more efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nLet's see an clear example:\r\n\r\n`Before`\r\n```python\r\ndef process_data(data):\r\n    for i in range(len(data)):\r\n        data[i] = data[i].strip()\r\n        data[i] = data[i].lower()\r\n        data[i] = data[i].replace(\" \", \"_\")\r\n    return data\r\n```\r\n\r\n`After`\r\n```python\r\ndef process_data(data):\r\n    return [item.strip().lower().replace(\" \", \"_\") for item in data]\r\n```\r\n";
